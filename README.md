# UCSD ECE276B PR3 

## Overview
In this assignment, you will implement a controller for a car robot to track a trajectory.

## Dependencies
This starter code was tested with: python 3.7, matplotlib 3.4, and numpy 1.20. 

## Starter code
### 1. main.py
This file contains examples of how to generate control inputs from a simple P controller and apply the control on a car model. This simple controller does not work well.
Your task is to replace the P controller with your own controller using CEC and GPI as described in the project statement.

### 2. utils.py
This file contains code to visualize the desired trajectory, car's trajectory and obstacles.
