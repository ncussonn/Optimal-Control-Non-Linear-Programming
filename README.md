# UCSD ECE276B PR3 

## Overview
Implemented a LQR controller with computed gains from a non-linear program solver for an agent to follow a given trajectory.

## Dependencies
This starter code was tested with: python 3.7, matplotlib 3.4, and numpy 1.20. 

## Starter code
### 1. main.py
Main file, computes optimal gains for agent using a NLP solver and uses them as control input for agent.

### 2. utils.py
This file contains code to visualize the desired trajectory, car's trajectory and obstacles.
